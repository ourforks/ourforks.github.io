## GitHub Fork Storage

Welcome! **GitHub fork storage** is a project aimed to make organizing your profile and repositories list.

### How does it work??

1. [Request an invite](#please-invite-me)
2. [Transfer any existing forks](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/transferring-a-repository) into the organization once you have accepted your invite
3. You are good to go! In the future, when you fork, you should select this organization as the fork destination so it goes directly here.

### Please invite me!

To get an invite (which gives you access to read all public repositories, transfer repositories into the organization, and permission to fork directly to the organization), [click here](https://github.com/ourforks/Invite/issues/new) and fill out the template.
